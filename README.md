# Java-Project-Work
## Sort-Algorithms
This contains the sample algorithm code for different sorting algorithms

## SortManager
This contains the SortManager project which sorts an array using any of
the following algorithms based on the user's selection

- Bubblesort algorithm
- Insertionsort algorithm
- Selectionsort algorithm
- Mergesort algorithm
- Quicksort algorithm
- Binarytreesort algorithm

The array length can be chosen by the user and can vary upto 1000.Intensive
Junit testing is done to ensure code quality.

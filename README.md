##Sort-Algorithms
This contains the sample algorithm code for different sorting algorithms

##SortManager
This contains the SortManager project which sorts an array using any of
the following algorithms based on the user's selection

1.Bubblesort algorithm
2.Insertionsort algorithm
3.Selectionsort algorithm
4.Mergesort algorithm
5.Quicksort algorithm
6.Binarytreesort algorithm

The array length can be chosen by the user and can vary upto 1000.Intensive
Junit testing is done to ensure code quality.
